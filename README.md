## Introduction

### Project Description
This project investigate datasets from Gapminder World website, I'm discussing the factors that contribute to the quality of life of citizens in some countries over the years from 1990 to 2005. I chose these specific metrics because every single one of them affects people's lives heavily and almost shape their lives. I was wondering when I was choosing these data "How population growth affects people's lives? how these metrics contribute to suicide rate around the globe? and what are the correlation between these rates and each other?".

### Dataset Description
1- Population Density Average number of people of each square km of the land in the given country `Population > population density`
2- Income Per Person Gross domestic product per person adjusted for differences in purchasing power (in international dollars, fixed 2011 prices, PPP based on 2011 ICP). Income
3- Life Expectancy The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same. Life expectancy
4- Human Development Index Human Development Index is an index used to rank countries by level of "human development". It contains three dimensions: health level, educational level and living standard. Society > Human development index
5- Suicide Rate Mortality due to self-inflicted injury, per 100 000 standard population, age adjusted. This rate is calculated as if all countries had the same age composition of the population. Health > Mental Health > Suicide / 100k people
